# Java-Basic-Calculator
Thi is the first program I wrote when I was in high school. It is a very basic calculator, supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. It takes a string of usual mathematical expression as input, like (12*(2+7.5))^3. The main difficulty of this program is to break the string and determine the sequence of operation.

Don't ask me what those comments are; I have also forgotten. 

Usage: Call function public static double Calculate(String Original). The input string should be a usual mathematical expression, like (12*(2+7.5))^3. Only parentheses "()" are allowed, please don't use brackets "[]".
