# Java-Basic-Calculator
Thi is the first program I wrote when I was in high school. It is a very basic calculator, supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. It takes a string of usual mathematical expression as input, like (12*2+7)^3. The main difficulty of this program is to break the string and determine the sequence of operation.

Usage: Call function public static double Calculate(String Original). The input string should be a usual mathematical expression.
